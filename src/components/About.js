First time fully automatic control of composition in free radical copolymerization.

•
First time simultaneous fully automatic control of composition and molecular weight in free radical copolymerization.

•
Combined composition and molecular weight controller uses only three directly measurable parameters and requires no detailed kinetic models.

•
Various composition and molecular weight trajectories are used to illustrate power of the new capability.
